% get the time of the first and last data cycle in all techsas files with stream name instream, and
% return the envelope times as matlab datenums; return a third argument which is the
% total number of data cycles in all the matching files.
%
% If the tonly flag is set to 'fast' or 'f', then only the earliest and 
% latest files containing data are inspected;
% In the fast option, numdc is returned as -1 if data are found, 
% or nan if no data are found.

% The techsas files are searched for in a directory Mtechsas_root defined in
% the mexec setup. At sea, this will typically be a data area exported from a
% ship's computer and cross-mounted on the mexec processing machine
