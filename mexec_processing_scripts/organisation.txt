./*_process.m are wrapper functions

in ctd_steps, *_01_* can be done in parallel, but mfir_05_* must be done after all *_01*, *_02*, *_03*, *_04*

ctd processing is done one station at a time (***mctd_checkplots, mctd_evaluate_sensors)

sample processing is done on all available data

underway processing is done one day at a time (or can loop)

cruise_options/ has scripts used by many scripts/functions for setting cruise-specific processing parameters and choices
